Learning Git with giithubb :)


I'm Luiz a graphic designer and fall in love about photographs.
In nowadays I need to improve my abilitys, so.. I'll learning a little bit about web.

I just know html and CSS, but I need improve another skill as those ones:
Git

UX

It looks like simple, but don't. This try on me for ages, but now on. I won't  ever never give up. No more.
